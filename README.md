# Hello

``I have an aim to improve the world with technology and innovation. An enormous power is hidden
in the field of technology.
I am aiming to do all needed hard work to harness this energy and make it flow in right direction.
Great Scientist Albert Einstein has said: - "In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity."
If we see every difficulty as a new golden opportunity then we will find that there is no better time
to start then the current time and there is nothing as lost because an opportunity will always be
waiting in the future.
I follow the same ideology and always keep on moving forward to reach my goal.``
